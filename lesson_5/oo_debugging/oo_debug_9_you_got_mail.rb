Decipher and fix error in this code.

The problem with the original code in this exercise is that the `Mailing#send` method is located in the `Mailing` module. This module was not included in the method lookup chain for the `PostalService` class. I simply included the module and the code worked -- that class gained access to the method. I am confused about why it thinks the method name is `860 Blackbird Ln.`.

Turns out, there is an `Object#send` method that expects a method name as an argument. We're accidentally overriding this method with my solution, and a better choice would be to change the name of `Mailing#send` to `Mailing#send_mail` or something similar.
